# 📦 Super Store Sales Analytics & Forecast Dashboard
🔍 Project Overview
This project showcases two advanced Power BI dashboards designed to provide comprehensive sales analytics and forecasting for a retail company.

By integrating data visualization with predictive analytics, this project empowers decision-makers to uncover hidden patterns, assess real-time performance, and proactively plan for future demands.
